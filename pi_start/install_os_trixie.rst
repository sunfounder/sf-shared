2. Installing the Operating System
===================================

.. _start_imager:

Before using your Raspberry Pi, you need to install **Raspberry Pi OS** onto a microSD card.  
This guide explains how to do that using **Raspberry Pi Imager** in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

**Required Components**

* A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
* A microSD card (16GB or larger; recommended brands: SanDisk, Samsung)
* A microSD card reader

-------------------

**1. Install Raspberry Pi Imager**


#. Visit the official Raspberry Pi Imager download page: |shared_link_rpi_imager|. Download the correct installer for your operating system.

-------------------

**2. Install the OS to the microSD Card**

#. Insert your microSD card into your computer using a card reader. Back up any important data before proceeding.

#. When Raspberry Pi Imager opens, you will see the **Device** page. Select your Raspberry Pi model from the list (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5, 4, 3, or Zero 2W).

.. _end_imager:


#. Go to the **OS** section and choose the recommended **Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)** option.

.. start_choose_os

#. In the **Storage** section, select your microSD card. For safety, unplug other USB drives so only the SD card appears in the list.

   .. note::

      Be very careful when selecting the storage device.  
      Choosing the wrong drive may erase important data.

#. Click **Next** to continue to the customization step.

   .. note::

      * If you will connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse directly to your Raspberry Pi, you may click **SKIP CUSTOMISATION**.  
      * If you plan to set up the Raspberry Pi *headless* (Wi-Fi remote access), you must complete the customization settings.

**3. OS Customization Settings**

#. **Set Hostname**

   * Give your Raspberry Pi a unique hostname.  
   * You can connect to it later using ``hostname.local``.
