What Else Do You Need?
===============================

Before we start playing with this kit, let’s prepare the essential hardware.

Required Components
------------------------------

* **Raspberry Pi**

  The Raspberry Pi acts as the **brain**, handling all computing, sensing, and control tasks.  
  
  * **Compatible models**: Raspberry Pi 5, Raspberry Pi 4, 3, or Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

* **Power Adapter**

  Prepare a suitable power supply based on your Raspberry Pi model:

  - **Raspberry Pi 5**: 5V 5A USB-C (recommended: official 27W PD power supply).  
  - **Raspberry Pi 4**: 5V 3A USB-C.  
  - **Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+**: 5V 2.5A Micro-USB.  
  - **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**: 5V 2A Micro-USB.

  Using a stable power source helps prevent undervoltage and ensures reliable operation.

* **Micro SD Card**

  The Raspberry Pi does not have a built-in hard drive. It boots and stores all files on a **Micro SD card**.

  * Minimum: **16GB**  
  * Recommended: **32GB** for better stability  
  * Brand: Use reliable options such as **SanDisk** or **Samsung** to avoid read/write errors  
  
Optional Components
------------------------

Although not strictly required, the following peripherals will greatly improve your learning and debugging experience:

* **Monitor (HDMI or TV)** 

  For beginners, we strongly recommend a display with an HDMI input, so you can easily configure Raspberry Pi OS and run graphical programs.

* **HDMI Cable (Standard / Mini / Micro)**
 
  Different Raspberry Pi models use different HDMI connectors, be sure to check your Pi model and prepare the correct cable. 
  
  * **Raspberry Pi 4 / 5**: Micro HDMI  
  * **Raspberry Pi 3**: Standard HDMI  
  * **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**: Mini HDMI

* **Keyboard & Mouse**

  Very useful during the initial setup of Raspberry Pi OS. Later, you may switch to remote access (SSH/VNC), but for beginners we recommend preparing a basic USB or wireless set.

**Tips for Preparation**

* If you purchased this kit, most accessories are included, but you still need to prepare the Raspberry Pi board, Micro SD card, and power adapter separately.  
* Not sure what to buy? The most stable and universal choice is: **Raspberry Pi 4/5 (2GB) + Official Power Supply + 32GB Micro SD card**.
