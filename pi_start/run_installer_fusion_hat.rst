Configure Power & Install Software (Important)
================================================================

In this chapter, you’ll install the related software, configure audio, set up safe power management and learn how to handle shutdowns.

.. _install_fusion_hat:

Install ``fusion-hat`` module
----------------------------------

For this kit, all GPIO functionalities are managed through the Fusion HAT. Therefore, you need to use the accompanying ``fusion-hat`` library to access and control them.

Run the command in terminal to install ``fusion-hat`` module.

   .. raw:: html

      <run></run>

   .. code-block::

      curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunfounder/sunfounder-installer-scripts/main/install-fusion-hat.sh | sudo bash

.. |shared_link_fusion_hat| raw:: html

    <a href="https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/fusion-hat/en/latest/" target="_blank">Fusion HAT+</a>

.. note:: For the detail of fusion-hat, please refer to the |shared_link_fusion_hat|.


After installation completes, reboot the Raspberry Pi. Then execute the audio setup script:

   .. raw:: html

      <run></run>

   .. code-block::

      sudo /opt/setup_fusion_hat_audio.sh

This completes the software installation process for the Fusion HAT.

Configure and Use Safe Shutdown
-----------------------------------

The Fusion HAT relies on the Raspberry Pi’s shutdown signal to fully manage system power.  
To ensure a safe and reliable power-off process, you need to **configure the shutdown behavior** according to your Raspberry Pi model and then use the **power button** correctly.

**For Raspberry Pi 5 and 4B**

These models support complete power-off after shutdown. The Fusion HAT monitors the 3.3V line to detect the Pi’s power state.

1. Place the jumper on **RPI_STATE → Pi3V3**.

2. Edit the EEPROM configuration manually:

   .. code-block::

      sudo raspi-config

3. Navigate to **Advanced Options → A12 Shutdown Behaviour**.

   .. image:: /_shared/pi_start/img/shutdown_behaviour.png

4. Select **B1 Full Power Off**.

   .. image:: /_shared/pi_start/img/run_power_off.png

5. Save the changes. You will be prompted to reboot for the new settings to take effect.

**For Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, 3B, 3B+**

These models do **not** support full power-off using 3.3V. Instead, GPIO26 must be configured as a shutdown state indicator.

1. Place the jumper on **RPI_STATE → IO26**.

   .. image:: /_shared/pi_start/img/state_io26.jpg
      :width: 400

2. Edit the ``/boot/firmware/config.txt`` file:

   .. code-block::

      sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt

3. Add the following line at the end to set GPIO26 as low on shutdown and high on power-up:

   .. code-block::

      dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,gpio_pin=26,active_low=1

4. Reboot to apply changes:

   .. code-block::

      sudo reboot

**Using the Power Button for Safe Shutdown**

After the shutdown configuration is completed, you can safely power off the PiCar-X using the Fusion HAT power button.

* **Soft Shutdown (Recommended)**

  * Press and hold the power button for **2 seconds**.  
  * The two power LEDs will flash rapidly.  
  * Release the button → Fusion HAT triggers Raspberry Pi shutdown.  
  * Once the shutdown is complete, Fusion HAT will cut power automatically.  
  * This protects your SD card and files.

* **Hard Shutdown (Emergency Only)**

  * If the system becomes unresponsive, press and hold the power button for **5+ seconds**.  
  * Fusion HAT will force power-off.  
  * Warning: This may corrupt the SD card or system files. Use only when necessary.
