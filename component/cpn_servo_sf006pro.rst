SF006PRO Servo
===================

This servo is a small and reliable actuator that operates on 4–6V, offering smooth movement and up to 180° of control. It provides good torque, fast response, and low power consumption, making it suitable for robotics, mechanisms, and general hobby projects.  
Its standard 3-pin PWM interface makes it easy to connect to microcontrollers such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

**How a Servo Works**


A typical servo consists of several internal components:

* Case  
* Output shaft  
* Gear system  
* Potentiometer  
* DC motor  
* Control (embedded) board  

The microcontroller sends PWM control signals to the servo through the signal pin.  
The control board interprets the signal and drives the DC motor, which rotates the gear system. After passing through the gear reduction system, the shaft turns with increased torque.

The output shaft is mechanically connected to the potentiometer. As the shaft rotates, the potentiometer changes its voltage output. The control board reads this feedback to determine the current position, adjusting the motor’s rotation until the shaft reaches and holds the target angle.

**PWM Control**

The rotation angle of the servo is determined by the width of the PWM pulse. The servo normally expects one pulse every **20 ms**.

Typical pulse behavior:

* **1.5 ms** → Neutral position (about 90°)  
* **< 1.5 ms** → Moves counterclockwise from center  
* **> 1.5 ms** → Moves clockwise from center  

Most hobby servos accept pulse widths between **0.5 ms and 2.5 ms**, corresponding to their full movement range.
